## General Information
Droom is essentially the Tinder of the job search. Create one of two different user types (Job seeker, or Employer), input the necessary information asked by the application, and start searching users of the opposite user type! Currently there is no functionality to actually 'swipe left' or 'swipe right' within the application, so there is no matching or messaging, but possibly soon to come!

## Technologies
Droom is created with :
* React 16.12.0
* Redux 4.0.5
* react-router-dom 5.1.2
* axios 0.19.2
* Bootstrap 4.4.1
* Jest 4.2.4

Backend is located here :
